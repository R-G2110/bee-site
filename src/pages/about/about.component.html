      <h2>About us</h2>

      <p>Bee Site was born from a passion for bees and a deep respect for nature. Our journey began in 2010 with just two beehives and a dream to produce the purest honey possible.</p>

      <p>Today, we manage over 200 hives across carefully selected locations known for their diverse flora and clean environment. We believe in sustainable beekeeping practices that support the health of bees and the ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Our commitment is to bring you honey exactly as nature intended: raw, unfiltered, and packed with all its natural enzymes and beneficial properties.</p>
